        <h2>Nathan Luke</h2>
        <h2>CIT Major</h2>

        <p>Hi, I am Nathan and I am a cybersecurity major.</p>

        <p>I love to play tennis! I'm also into retro gaming including learning the history behind each aspect of it.</p>

        <p>I'll finish with a favorite scripture - Ether 12:6</p>

        <article>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</article>
