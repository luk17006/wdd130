            <p>To quote a fictional ninja, "The flow of time is always cruel... Its speed seems different for each person, but no one can change it... A thing that doesn't change with time is a memory of younger days..."</p>
            <p>That last part could certainly be argued. For decades, individuals and families have captured their memories in the moment, hoping to preserve them for future generations. From the VHS and Video8 tapes of the 80's to the VHS-C and Hi8 formats of the 90's, to the DVDs of the 2000's; these formats - and many others - were entrusted to store our most precious and irreplacable memories and moments.</p>
            <p>But that trust has been betrayed.</p>
            <p>Every physical format has a shelf-life, and the home recorded ones are at the most risk of early and irreversible decay; especially those stored in sheds, garages, and attics over the years.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Digital Memory Works, where I preserve media that matters. I am taking the fight to media degredation by digitizing aging media formats into digital files; files that can be backed-up, shared freely, and played on today's devices.</p>
            <p>This website is designed to help you bring your analog memories into the digital age using simple tools and clear instructions. And if you'd rather not tackle the task yourself, you can reach out to me to inquire about my digitation services.</p>
            <p>Do not wait any longer! Now is the time to preserve your personal media - for real this time!</p>
