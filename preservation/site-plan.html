      <h3>Addressing the Issue</h3>
      <p>Really, no one uses videotapes these days, and while many DVDs are still playable, they won’t always be. The harsh reality is that everything has a shelf-life. Tapes degrade even if kept in the best condition over the decades, and yes, even DVDs will fail too – and many already have.</p>
      <p>So many people are unaware of this fact because new technologies often leave older standards forgotten in an attic (where harsh temperatures expedite their demise). To make matters worse, while a blockbuster film on DVD could last around 10 to 20 years at best, a home-burned DVD will only last 5 to 10 years. This is because commercial DVDs are “stamped” with their data, but home-burned discs are, well, burned. This difference in how data is recorded leads to a difference in shelf life.</p>
      <p>You can see how this can lead to a major false sense of security for people who think their precious home videos are safe because their other movies are safe too—or so they think. For those who outsourced their tapes to be digitized into DVDs by a service such as Costco Photo or Walgreens Photo services, they only bought themselves a handful of years because those discs are also merely burned.</p>
      <p>The point is that the only way to keep your irreplaceable home videos is to digitize them into files and back them up redundantly. This is exactly what my website aims to address and guide others in.</p>
      <p>My Digital Memory Works website will be an important tool for raising awareness of videotape and DVD degradation. People will come to this site to learn about this inevitability and what to do about it.</p>
      <p>I can’t stress this enough: my website is not to be used to promote, encourage, or perform piracy or any other form of copyright infringement. This service is strictly to help individuals and families preserve their personally recorded media for generations to come.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>The Digitization Process</h3>
      <p>This section will cover what equipment is required and how to operate it to successfully capture videotapes, audiotapes, and discs into digital files. For tapes, it will include information on VHS, VHS-C, and Hi8 videotape formats, as well as audio cassette. For discs, it will include information on CD, DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra-HD disc formats.</p>
      <p>Because all these formats will eventually fail, this section is designed to help you secure your family memories and save them for the long term, so if one copy becomes corrupted, the content isn’t lost forever. This will primarily be encouraged through storing copies of all digitized files on at least two separate storage mediums. This can be done through two separate storage drives, two separate cloud storage solutions (could get expensive), or a mix of the two. Additionally, it will be encouraged to share copies of the digitized files with family members, thus spreading the joy of nostalgic memories, and creating even more backups.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Log of Digitized Media</h3>
      <p>Lastly, my website will feature a log of digitized media; essentially an odometer to track the work I’ve done personally, whether for myself or for others. This will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many tapes and discs I’ve preserved, broken down by format</li>
        <li>How many hours of video and audio I’ve digitized</li>
        <li>How much total data I’ve saved (in GBs or TBs)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This log will offer a transparent view of my experience and the scale of preservation work I’ve contributed to. While also serving as a bit of a personal accolade, I hope it will also prove that my skills are up to the task. And, perhaps most importantly, this log of data can show just how much irreplaceable and oh so important memories have been saved from the doom of media decay, of which there is no return.</p>
